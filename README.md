The Holmes and Rahe stress scale is a list of 43 stressful life events that can contribute to illness. The scale is used by health care professionals to help identify whether a person is experiencing a high amount of stress.

This can be helpful in determining whether someone is at risk for developing an illness, or if they may benefit from stress-reduction interventions.

History of the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale
The Holmes and Rahe stress scale was developed in 1967 by psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe while working at the University of Washington.1 The scale was based on a study of over 5,000 medical patients who were asked to rate the life-changing events they had experienced in the previous two years.

They originally designed the scale to be used in research to help identify possible links between stress and illness.

Since its inception, the Holmes and Rahe stress scale has been widely used by healthcare professionals. It is one of the most well-known and researched tools for measuring stress.

Items on the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale
There are 43 items on the Holmes and Rahe stress scale.2 Each item is assigned a certain number of points, based on its perceived stressfulness. The total number of points a person scores can give an indication of their overall stress level. Some of the items on the scale include the following:

Death of a spouse: 100 points
Divorce: 73 points
Marital separation: 65 points
Jail term: 63 points
Death of a close family member: 63 points
Personal injury or illness: 53 points
Marriage: 50 points
Job loss: 47 points
Scores on the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale
Overall, total scores can range from 0 to 430 points.2

A score of 300 or more on the Holmes and Rahe stress scale indicates high stress. This means that the person is at an increased risk of developing an illness.
A score between 150 and 299 points indicates a moderate amount of stress.
A score below 150 indicates a low amount of stress.
However, it is essential to remember that the scale is only meant to be used as a guide and that other factors, such as a person's individual stress tolerance, can also affect their risk for illness.

How to Administer the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale
The Holmes and Rahe stress scale can be self-administered, or it can be administered by a healthcare professional.2

If you are administering the scale yourself, you will need to recall the stressful events that have occurred in your life over the past year. For each event, you will need to note the date it occurred and the number of points it is worth. Once you have all of this information, you can add up your total score to get an idea of your overall stress level.
If a healthcare professional is administering the scale, they will likely ask you about stressful events that have occurred in your life over the past year. They will then record your answers and calculate your total score.
Interpreting the Results
If you have a high stress score on the Holmes and Rahe stress scale, it does not necessarily mean that you will develop an illness. However, it does indicate that you are at an increased risk. If you are experiencing a high amount of stress, it is important to take steps to reduce your stress level. This may include exercise, relaxation techniques, and counseling.
